    ----------
    grid_dict: 
        dictionary of parameters sets, keyed by the type of grid (str) for plotting heatmaps
        Each element in the list should be a tuple of:
        1) FOV grid (ndarray)
        2) vmin (minimum of colormap)
        3) vmax (max of colourmap)
        4) colourmap
        5) colourmap center
        6) annotation size
    fig_savepath: str
        directory to save the figure
    dpi: int
        dpi for saving the figure
    iteration: int
        indicates which iteration of decoding you are using
        only affects the naming of the saved figure
